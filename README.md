Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) Code for CrossOver
CodeWeavers is a strong supporter of Free and Open Source Software (FOSS). A key benefit for a user of FOSS Software is that the source code is provided to them.
CodeWeavers uses several projects that are licensed under either the GPL or LGPL, as well as a number of projects that are licensed under other licenses, such as the X11 license.
However, we strongly recommend that users go directly to the home page for each of these projects rather than using our source code, as the projects generally have more up to date versions (along with the necessary instructions on how to build the software).
